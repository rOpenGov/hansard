# hansard 0.5.3.9000

## General improvements

Speeding up of some tests.

Better tidying on `lords_interests()`.

Changes to structure of `lord_vote_record()` to make it slightly faster and more consistent with other functions.


# hansard 0.5.3

## New features

`all_answered_questions()`, `commons_answered_questions()`, `commons_oral_questions()`, `commons_written_questions()`, `lords_written_questions()` now accept arrays of member IDs and department names.

Added `verbose` parameter to all functions. If `verbose`=TRUE, messages displaying the progress of the API call are sent to the console.

## General improvements

Sped up edm details retrieval in `mp_edms()` where `full_data`==TRUE and there are multiple MP IDs.

Major increase in speed for `constituencies(current=TRUE)`.

Small increase in speed for all functions.

`all_answered_questions()` can now handle departmental ID numbers passed as characters.

Now uses the `stringr` package to remove case sensitivity from queries. 

## Bug Fixes

Fixed bug that prevented `lords_written_questions()` from retrieving more than 500 results at a time.


# hansard 0.5.2

## New features

`mp_edms()` now accepts lists and character vectors of MP IDs, and returns them all in one tibble.

`mp_edms()` now includes `start_date` and `end_date` parameters

## Bug Fixes

Fixed `mp_edms()` to return more useful error if the requested MP does not have any Early Day Motions that meet the search parameters.

The `signatory` parameter in `mp_edms()` is now behaving properly.

## Documentation updates

General improvement to documentation

# hansard 0.5.0

## New features

All functions have a wrapper function with the same name, but with `hansard_` prefixed. Existing names have remained untouched.

Addition of `house` and `answering_body` parameters to `all_answered_questions()` function.

## Bug Fixes

Fixed bug in `lord_vote_record()` which produced an error if requesting both lobbies, but a peer had only voted in one of the lobbies.

# hansard 0.4.9

## New features

Party name columns in `election_candidates()` and `election_results(all_data=TRUE)` are now in alphabetical order.

## Bug Fixes

Fixed bug in `all_answered_questions()` that wasn't returning results when `tabling_mp_id` is a parameter.

## Documentation changes

`lords_interests()` and `bill_stage_types()` seperated from `members` and `bills`, respectively, into their own distinct functions.


# hansard 0.4.8

## New features

New `all_data` parameter in `election_results()` to return the number of votes cast for each party in each constituency.

New `election_candidates()` function, which returns the name of all candidates standing in an election.

New `epetition_tibble()` function, which returns a tibble with all epetitions submitted to parliament, subject to parameters. This function offers more flexibility for returning basic details about a group of epetitions than the existing `epetition()` function, which is designed to provide more detailed information on a single epetition.

# hansard 0.4.7

## New features

Additional URL stripping from variable values if `tidy`=TRUE.

Added `tabling_mp_id` parameter to `all_answered_questions()`.

## Bug Fixes

Fixed bug in `members()` where looking up a single member returned a tibble with two rows.

Fixed bug in `mp_edms()` where additional data was not being returned if `full_data`=TRUE.

Fixed bug in `election_results()` where it did not return data if `constit_details`=TRUE.

Fixed bugs where empty queries in `election_results()`, `members()` and possibly other functions were returning incorrect errors in some environments or circumstances.

# hansard 0.4.6

## New features

Added optional `tidy_style` parameter, allowing users to decide which style of "snake_case", "camelCase" and "period.case" they want variable names to be in, if `tidy`=TRUE.

The `elections()` function now accepts `start_date` and `end_date` parameters. As the API called by the `elections()` function only accepts one additional argument not included in the package (the label of the election), changed the `extra_args` parameter to `label` to query that argument. 

The `tidy` parameter now changes date values to POSIXct class with `as.POSIXct()` when the API returns date information, or to POSIXct with the `parse_date_time` from the `lubridate` package where the API returns both date and time information.

`tidy` parameter now strips out more unneeded character strings from API response.

## Bug fixes

Updated `elections()` to work with new API syntax.

# hansard 0.4.5

## Date Classes

`hansard()` functions with `start_date` and `end_date` parameters now accept any input that can be coerced to a date with the `as.Date()` function.

# hansard 0.4.4

## Election types

Added a `type` parameter to `elections()`, to return all elections of a particular type.

## Constituency details

Added optional `constit_details` parameter to `election_result()` function. If TRUE, `constit_details` retrieves additional constituency details from `constituencies()`, most notably including GSS code.

## Bug fixes

Fixed bug on `commons_oral_question_times()` where some calls did not return tibbles.

Fixed bug in `lords_divisons()` that did prevented vote summary queries from being returned.

Removed superfluous `x` from names in `elections()` when tidy=TRUE.

# hansard 0.4.3

## Voting margins

Added optional `calculate_percent` parameter to `election_result()` function. If TRUE, `calculate_percent` calculates the turnout percentage for each constituency in the tibble and the majority of the winning candidate to one decimal place, and includes this information in the tibble in columns labelled `turnout_percentage` and `majority_percentage`. Defaults to FALSE.

# hansard 0.4.2

## tibbling

`hansard()` now uses tibbles instead of data frames as the data class returned from API calls.

# hansard 0.4.1

Fixes discrepency between output displayed and vignette and actual package output (#7, @pssguy)

tidy parameter in `members_search()` now does some additional tidying up.

# hansard 0.4.0

Major re-write, breaks compatibility with previous versions, please check your code to ensure it still works with the new package, as console input functionality has been removed from all functions. These changes ensure greater consistency in syntax across the package, in both the body and formals of the functions.

If you need the old console based functions, they can be accessed through the `hansardconsole` package at <https://github.com/EvanOdell/hansard-console>.

Changes have been made to most functions, including:

`all_answered_questions()`: Console interface is gone, now operates as a function with the ID for a given MP accepted as the only function parameter. Returns all answered questions if blank.

`bills()`: Rewritten, now with the ability to look up bills by ID, as well as bill amendments. Added `bill_stage_types()` function.

`commons_answered_questions()`: Changed parameter name `answeredBy` to `answered_by`; improved ability to search by date, dropped console inputs.

`commons_divisions()`: Removed console inputs, simplified options.

`commons_oral_question_times()`: Simplified function, removed need for console input.

`commons_oral_questions()`: Simpler process, same result, more flexibility in requests

`commons_answered_questions()`: Removed need for console input.

`commons_terms()`: Simplified formals.

`commons_written_questions()`: Removed need for console input.

`constituencies()`: Simplified formals.

`early_day_motions()`: Changed all camelCase to snake_case.

`election_results()`: Removed console input, simplified formals.

`elections()`: Removed console input, simplified formals.

`lords_attendance()`: Removed console input, simplified formals.

`lord_vote_record()`: Removed console input, simplified formals.

`lords_divisions()`: Removed console input, simplified formals.

`members()`: Added additional `commons_members()`, `commons_interests()`, `lords_members()` and `lords_interests()` functions.

`mp_edms()`: Improved functionality, can now call full text of early day motions.

`mp_questions()`: Changed `questionType` to `question_type`

`mp_vote_record()`: Minor re-write

`papers_laid()`: Incorporates new features in the API

`publication_logs()`: Minor re-write, now includes start and end dates.

`sessions_info()`: Added `start_date()` and `end_date()` parameters

`tv_channels()` New function.

`tv_clips()`: New function, previously part of `tv_programmes`.

`tv_programmes()`: Minor re-write, now includes ability to select legislature.

Adding of `research_briefings_lists()` functions.

# hansard 0.3.4

## Bug fixes

The `lords_attendance()` function was not working. It was returning empty data frames when searching by date and failing entirely when trying to retrieve all attendance. This was due to url encoding issues, which have now been identified and fixed. (#4, @meenaparam)

Fixed spelling of amendments, so that `lords_ammendments()` is now `lords_amendments(0`. The `lords_ammendments()` function has been deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.

# hansard 0.3.3

## Bug Fixes

# hansard 0.3.2

## Bug Fixes

# hansard 0.3.0

## Requesting data through function parameters

In response to a request, I've added three new functions that allow you to request the voting record of both MPs and members of the House of Lords by using their ID as a function parameter, rather than as a console input. They are:

`lords_vote_record()`

`mp_questions()`

`mp_vote_record()`

`mp_edms()`

The option to use console input has been preserved in `commons_divisions()`, `lords_divisions()`, `commons_written_questions()` and `commons_oral_questions()`, along with other features not available in the new functions.

## Bug fixes

This update fixes an issue with `lords_written_questions()` and `commons_written_questions()` where the functions returned a 404 error on some requests.

# hansard 0.2.5

## Introducing the hansard package

Provides functions to download data from the data.parliament.uk APIs.

Because of the structure of the data.parliament.uk API, there is a named function for each type of available data for ease of use. Functions for each new API will be added as and when they become available on data.parliament.uk. See the package documentation for details on each function and the type of data available.
