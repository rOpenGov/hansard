Description: Provides functions to download data from the
    <http://www.data.parliament.uk/> APIs. Because of the structure of the
    API, there is a named function for each type of available data for
    ease of use, as well as some functions designed to retrieve specific
    pieces of commonly used data. Functions for each new API will be added
    as and when they become available.
