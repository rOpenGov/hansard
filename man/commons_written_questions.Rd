\arguments{
\item{mp_id}{Accepts a member ID or an array of member IDs and returns a tibble with all written questions asked by that MP or array of MPs. If \code{NULL}, mp_id is not included as a query parameter. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{answering_department}{Accepts a string with a department name or partial name, or an array of such strings. The query acts as a search, so passing \code{'health'} will return all questions answered by the Department of Health. If \code{NULL}, answering_department is not included as a query parameter. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{start_date}{The earliest date to include in the tibble. Defaults to \code{'1900-01-01'}. Accepts character values in \code{'YYYY-MM-DD'} format, and objects of class \code{Date}, \code{POSIXt}, \code{POSIXct}, \code{POSIXlt} or anything else than can be coerced to a date with \code{as.Date()}.}

\item{end_date}{The latest date to include in the tibble. Defaults to current system date. Defaults to \code{'1900-01-01'}. Accepts character values in \code{'YYYY-MM-DD'} format, and objects of class \code{Date}, \code{POSIXt}, \code{POSIXct}, \code{POSIXlt} or anything else than can be coerced to a date with \code{as.Date()}.}

\item{extra_args}{Additional parameters to pass to API. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{tidy}{Fix the variable names in the tibble to remove special characters and superfluous text, and converts the variable names to a consistent style. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{tidy_style}{The style to convert variable names to, if \code{tidy = TRUE}. Accepts one of \code{'snake_case'}, \code{'camelCase'} and \code{'period.case'}. Defaults to \code{'snake_case'}.}
